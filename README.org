* SQL-like operations over fixed field DBs

See [[https://m00natic.github.io/lisp/manual-jit.html][Uniform Structured Syntax, Metaprogramming and Run-time Compilation]]

This is a Common Lisp library which is to enable subset of SQL-like
operations over DBs with fields/columns with fixed number of ASCII
bytes.  Thus far it works on files in such format.

** Declare DBs

The defspec macro is to be used to register a DB with respective
schema.  Here's how the article example would look like:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (defspec (recordS5         ;db name, letter case doesn't matter
            :file            ;db type, currently only :file is supported
            "/path/to/records5.db")     ;filename
           ;; declare fields in order, offsets are automatically assigned
           2                              ;2 unnamed filler bytes
           (cxr 2)                        ;named field with 2 bytes
           (type 1)
           (subcode 3)
           (date_eff 6)
           (date_disc 6)
           20
           (commercial_name 16))
#+END_SRC

** Operations

Here's the article example:

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
  (select (cxr subcode commercial_name date_disc) ;list of selected fields
          recordS5                                ;db name
          :where (and (like cxr "YY|XX")          ;where clause
                      (or (and (like COMMERCIAL_NAME "PET")
                               (= type "C"))
                          (and (= type "F")
                               (= commercial_name "MEAL")))
                      (< "180620" date_disc)
                      (< date_eff date_disc)))
#+END_SRC
